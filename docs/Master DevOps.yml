DevOps:
    - Automation
    - Get quick feeadbacks 
    - bring the operations team close to the development team
    - infrstructure as code
    - continuous deployment:
        - deploy new vesion of softwre on test environments
    - continuous integration:
        - run the tests nd code qulity checks
    - continuous delivery:
        - is continuous deployment in production
  
Docker:
    - standarized application packaging:
        - provides the deployments steps equal to each container, independent the diferences inside of it
        - if a microservice is build in javascript or python, after you generate an image, the nexts steps are the same
        - avoid error prone manual installations
        - it doesen't matter whatever is inside a docker image, you can run it in the same way
    - multi platform support:
        - you can run docker images in:
            - local machine
            - cloud
            - data center
            - whatever you want
    - light-weight and isolation:
        - light-weight compared to VM's
    - when one container fails, it doesn't impact to other continers
    - you can control the memory and cpu of each container
